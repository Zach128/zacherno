# zacherno
zaCherno is a basic game engine developed alongside Yan Chaernikov's Hazel game engine tutorial series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&amp;list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT). This is heavily based on said engine and therefore enforces that the linked guides be referenced for further understanding.
